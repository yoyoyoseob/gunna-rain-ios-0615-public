# Is it raining?

Why look outside when you can just look at your phone!

## Instructions

  1. We will be using the [forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/) API to get the weather. It's already downloaded
  2. Read the documentation to figure out how to get an instance of a [`Forecastr`](https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Forecastr) object. The `sharedManager` method should look just like a singleton!
  3. Get an API key from [forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io/register)
    - after registering, you'll find your API key at the bottom of the screen.
      **You don't need to enter billing information or anything — the free plan will be more than enough.**
  4. FISViewController is already set-up for you with one large label. The goal is to say **Yep** if it's raining and **Nope** if it's not. 
  5. Call the [getForecastsForLatitude:Longitude:time:exclusions:success:failure](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/Forecastr/0.1.2/Classes/Forecastr.html#//api/name/getForecastForLatitude:longitude:time:exclusions:success:failure:) method. It will return the current weather in the `@"currently"` key with a `@"precipProbability"` key. If that key is `1` then it is raining! **Remember any optional argument or block you can usually just put in `nil` and it will work**
  6. As you can see, this method requires a lat/lng. For now, just Google some coordinates (preferably not in the middle of the ocean). 
  7. This method separates the success and failure case into two separate blocks. In the success block, update the label with the appropriate message when you get the weather.
  8. If it's not raining right now, find some place it is raining. I'd checkout Portland... it's usually raining there.

## Extra Credit

  * Adjust the color of the UILabel to signify the probability of precip. Green if there's 0% chance, 50% chance of rain should be black, and a 100% chance of rain should be red.

## Advanced

  * As you can see, this requires a lat/lng. Sure, you could enter this manually, but that's not as fun! This is a great opportunity to try out getting your current location in iOS 8. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26134641/how-to-get-current-location-lat-long-in-ios-8">Here's a great StackOverflow on finding a user's current location</a>.
   **DO NOT SKIP OVER THE STUFF ABOUT adding strings to your info.plist file! You need to implement this for it to work!**
